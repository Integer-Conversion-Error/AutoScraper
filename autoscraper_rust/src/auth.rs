// This module might contain other authentication-related logic in the future,
// such as session management, password hashing (if not using Firebase), etc.

// For now, the primary token verification logic lives in `auth_middleware.rs`.

// Placeholder for potential future auth functions.
pub fn placeholder() {
    // This function does nothing, just keeps the file non-empty.
